# Machine-Failure-Analysis-Deloitte-Case-Study
## Project Overview
I conducted a data analysis on Deloitte's data to determine which types of machines experience the highest breakdown frequency across four factories:
- Daikibo-Berlin
- Daikibo-Factory-Meiyo
- Daikibo-Factory-Seiko
- Daikibo-Shenzhen

## Key Business Questions
- Which machine type experiences the most breakdowns overall?
- Which factory has the highest total machine failure count?
- Are breakdowns concentrated in specific equipment categories?
- Where should predictive maintenance efforts be prioritized?
- Is there a pattern suggesting operational or infrastructure weaknesses?

## Data Analysis Approach
The analysis aggregated breakdown counts by:
- Device Type
- Factory Location

## Visualization:
- Bar charts by machine type
- Bar charts by factory

# Findings
## Machine Type Breakdown Analysis

The most failure-prone machines and breakdown counts are:
_ LaserWelder	- 480 (Highest)
- LaserCutter	- 430
- HeavyDutyDrill	- 70
- Furnace	- 20
- CNC / ConveyorBelt / SpotWelder	- <10
- AirWrench / MetalPress	- Minimal

## Factory-Level Breakdown Analysis
- Factory	Breakdown Count (Approx.)
- Daikibo-Factory-Seiko	- 480 (Highest)
- Daikibo-Shenzhen	- 420
- Daikibo-Factory-Meiyo	- 110
- Daikibo-Berlin	- 20 (Lowest)
